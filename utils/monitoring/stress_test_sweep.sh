# Usage: ./stress_test_sweep.sh

# Purpose:
# Runs stress tests for both prime and fibonacci API endpoints, varying the number of concurrent requests (threads) 
# from 2 to 16 for each function. This script does not handle resource monitoringâ€”it only stresses the endpoints and helps evaluate server performance under different loads.

START_THREADS=2
END_THREADS=16
VALUE=500000
